     Access the logger for this Operation

     The `log` property can be used as the interface to access the logger.
     e.g. to output a message with `LogSeverity.Info` from inside
     the `Procedure`, do this:

     ```swift
     log.info("This is my message")
     ```

     To adjust the instance severity of the LoggerType for the
     `Procedure`, access it via this property too:

     ```swift
     log.severity = .Verbose
     ```

     The logger is a very simple type, and all it does beyond
     manage the enabled status and severity is send the String to
     a block on a dedicated serial queue. Therefore to provide custom
     logging, set the `logger` property:

     ```swift
     log.logger = { message in sendMessageToAnalytics(message) }
     ```

     By default, the Logger's logger block is the same as the global
     LogManager. Therefore to use a custom logger for all Operations:

     ```swift
     LogManager.logger = { message in sendMessageToAnalytics(message) }

    /**
     Ability to override Operation's built-in finishing behavior, if a
     subclass requires full control over when finish() is called.

     Used for GroupOperation to implement proper .Finished state-handling
     (only finishing after all child operations have finished).

     The default behavior of Operation is to automatically call finish()
     when:
     (a) the Operation is cancelled prior to it starting
         (in which case, the Operation will skip calling execute())
     (b) when willExecuteObservers log errors

     To ensure that an Operation subclass does not finish until the
     subclass calls finish():
     call `super.init(disableAutomaticFinishing: true)` in the init.

     IMPORTANT: If disableAutomaticFinishing == TRUE, the subclass is
     responsible for calling finish() in *ALL* cases, including when the
     operation is cancelled.

     You can react to cancellation using WillCancelObserver/DidCancelObserver
     and/or checking periodically during execute with something like:

     ```swift
     guard !cancelled else {
        // do any necessary clean-up
        finish()    // always call finish if automatic finishing is disabled
        return
